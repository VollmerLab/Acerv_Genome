Currently running Cafe:
	'phylogenetics/cafe_kegg/*' - #unique orthogroups in each kegg pathway
	'phylogenetics/cafe_kegg_koCopy/*' - #gene copies per KEGG ortholog
	'phylogenetics/cafe_orthogroup_copies/*' - #gene copies per Orthofinder ortholog


Already Run:
	'cafe_keggPaths/*' - #unique KEGG orthologs in each kegg pathway
	'cafe_keggCopies/*' - #gene copies in each KEGG pathway


Analysis goals:
1) What pathways showed expansions/contractions at the split between anemones and corals
2) What pathways showed expansions/contractions at split between robust and complex corals
3) What pathways showed expansions/contractions within the Acroporids
4) What pathways showed expansions/contractions in Acerv & the branch out to become Acerv - ie moving into the Caribbean


Expansions/contractions - number of orthologs within KEGG pathways = major changes in genome adding/removing functionality
	-use 'cafe_keggPaths/*'
	-just 'error model'??
